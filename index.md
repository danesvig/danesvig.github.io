## Bio
I am currently a fifth year PhD student in the
[Department of Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://cmor.rice.edu/) (CMOR)
(formerly Computational and Applied Mathematics (CAAM)) at 
[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in Houston, TX. 
My PhD research is advised by Prof. [Matthias Heinkenschloss](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~heinken/)
and focuses on developing optimization algorithms for problems with inexact objective and constraint information with applications in reduced order modeling and shape optimization.
I am currently a [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellow](https://ndseg.org/)
sponsored by the [Army Research Office](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/who-we-are/aro/). 
See my updated [CV](cv.pdf).
